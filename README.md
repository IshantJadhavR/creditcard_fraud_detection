Absolutely, Ishant! Here's a clean, professional README.md tailored for your Hugging Face Space deployment of the credit card fraud detection app. It highlights your model, usage instructions, and technical stack—all in a format that’s ready to copy-paste:

💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection App
This Streamlit-powered web app allows users to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a trained XGBoost model. It supports both batch predictions via CSV upload and manual single transaction input.
🚀 Live Demo
👉 Launch the App on Hugging Face Spaces

📦 Features
- Batch Prediction: Upload a CSV file of transactions and get fraud predictions with probability scores.
- Single Transaction Input: Manually input transaction features to test individual cases.
- Performance Metrics: View F1 Score, PR-AUC, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix for labeled data.
- Visualizations: Precision-Recall and ROC curves for deeper model insights.

🧠 Model Details
- Algorithm: XGBoost Booster
- Training Data: Kaggle Credit Card Fraud Dataset
- Preprocessing:
- Scaled Time and Amount using StandardScaler
- Used PCA-transformed features V1 to V28

📋 How to Use
🔹 Batch Prediction
- Upload a CSV file with columns: Time, Amount, V1 to V28, and optionally Class
- View fraud predictions and performance metrics
🔹 Manual Prediction
- Use sliders to input V1 to V28
- Enter Time and Amount
- Click Predict to get fraud probability

🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- XGBoost
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

📌 Notes
- The model was saved using Booster.save_model() for compatibility with Hugging Face Spaces.
- Predictions are binary: 0 = Legit, 1 = Fraud
- Metrics are only shown if the uploaded CSV includes the Class column

Let me know if you want to add screenshots, badges, or a license section. I can also help you write a short blog post or portfolio summary to showcase this project. You're building with clarity and polish—this README reflects that.
